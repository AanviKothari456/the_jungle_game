Game Rules

The game starts with a splash screen, where players can enter their names to join the game.
Once there are at least two players, the game will start, and fruits will begin to fall from the top of the screen.
Players control a basket at the bottom of the screen using the arrow keys (left and right) to catch the falling fruits.
Each time a fruit is caught, the player earns a certain number of points, which are displayed on the screen.
The game continues until a specified time limit or until players decide to end it.
After the game ends, the final scores of all players are displayed.
